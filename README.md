# lantern-di3
Welcome to LanternDie, the social network designed to fight invasive species! In the New York area, the lantern fly invasive species has become an unavoidable presence every fall, indicative of both the pervasiveness of the fly's damage to the native ecosystem and our community's efforts to eradicate it. After the New York City Government implemented a "kill on site" order for the fly, LanternDie seeks to concentrate New York's fight against the lantern fly by creating a gamified social network featuring lantern fly "kills". 


Welcome to LanternDie! This project began as a collaborative hackathon project, which I then independently developed into a functioning site. Our initial presentation won first prize for the Flora and Fauna category at Columbia DivHacks 2023.


The site is implemented with Django along with a PostgreSQL database.
