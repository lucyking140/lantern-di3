# lantern-di3
Welcome to LanternDie! This project began as a collaborative hackathon project, which I've now developed into a functioning site. In the New York area, the lantern fly invasive species has become an unavoidable presence every fall, indicitave of both the pervasiveness of the fly's damage to the native ecosystem and our community's rally to eradicate it. After the New York City Government implemented a kill on site order for the fly, LanternDie seeks to concentrate New York's fight against the fly by creating a gamified social network featuring lantern fly "kills". Our initial presentation won first prize for the Flora and Fauna category as Columbia DivHacks 2023.


The site is implemented with Django along with a PostgreSQL database, which I deployed for viewing purposes via Heroku with media file storage on AWS S3.
